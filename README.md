## Tech Used
Our platform harnesses the power of Hypersign SSI SDK, empowering users with a wide range of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) capabilities. Each Gamer Profile is uniquely assigned a Decentralized Identifier (DID), which is seamlessly registered on the blockchain. Moreover, the platform facilitates the issuance of score credentials and enhances security by utilizing the Encrypted Data Vault (EDV) SDK to securely store Verifiable Credentials (VC) within the user's personal Vault (EDV).
